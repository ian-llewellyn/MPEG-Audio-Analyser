MPEG Audio Analyser
===================

Thanks to some excellent information collated by Adam Bernstein at:
<http://mpgedit.org/mpgedit/mpeg_format/mpeghdr.htm#MPEG HEADER>
this little analyzer was possible. I've included the page in the repo
for fear that it might go missing some day..

Odly enough, the analyser is written in PHP.

To use, PHP should be installed at /usr/bin/php. Then just run:
./mpanalyse <mpeg_audio_filename>
OR
./mpanalyse <mpeg_audio_filename> --wave
to get a fancy CLI peak waveform (MP2 files with energy levels only)
